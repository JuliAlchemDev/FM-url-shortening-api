## Welcome! 👋

Thanks, Elmar ([@CodingWithJiro](https://github.com/CodingWithJiro)), for joining me to take on this Frontend Mentor challenge together! I'm really excited — I think this collaboration will be both fun and super helpful for us as we grow as developers. Let’s learn, experiment, support each other, and enjoy the process! 🚀💛

### 🤝 Collaborators & Collaboration Guidelines


 **Elmar Chaves - [CodingWithJiro](https://github.com/CodingWithJiro)**

 **Julia Alkhimova - [JuliAlchemDev](https://github.com/JuliAlchemDev)**


- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Keep Pull Requests small and focused.
- Be respectful and supportive during code reviews.
- Communicate blockers or questions early.

## 🎯 The challenge

Our challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [Clean URI API](https://cleanuri.com/docs) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

**Users should be able to:**

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

other part is to practice github work flow

## 🛠️ Building  project

### Basic structure
````
/url-shortening-api
  /assets
    /fonts
    /design
    /images
    /styles
  /scripts
  index.html
  README.md
````

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Git & Github Workflow

#### **GitHub Workflow**

In this project we'll be using a simple and clear Git workflow:

#### **Main Branches**
- **main** → Production-ready code
- **dev** → Active development base branch

#### **Feature Flow**
1. Create a feature branch from `dev`:
   ```
   feature/your-feature-name

   ex -> feature/header-JuliAlchemDev
   ex -> feature/url-form-CodingWithJiro
   ```

2. Commit changes in small, meaningful increments.
3. Open a Pull Request from your feature branch → `dev`.
4. Collaborator reviews and approves.
5. Merge into `dev`.

Once the project is complete, `dev` will be merged into `main`.


## 📌 Project Tasks

Tasks will be tracked using GitHub Issues and Projects.

Example tasks:
- Set up project structure
- Build base HTML layout
- Apply responsive styles
- Integrate Clean URI API
- Implement link history
- Polish accessibility and visual details
